Q. Is there any way to use Qua\+Zip\+File in Qt where you are supposed to use normal (non-\/zipped) file, but not through Q\+I\+O\+Device A\+PI?

A. Usually not. For example, if you are passing file name to some database driver (like S\+Q\+Lite), Qt usually just passes this name down to the 3rd-\/party library, which is usually does not know anything about Q\+I\+O\+Device and therefore there is no way to pass Qua\+Zip\+File as a normal file. However, if we are talking about some place where you pass file name, and then internally use Q\+File to open it, then it is a good idea to make an overloaded method, which accepts a Q\+I\+O\+Device pointer. Then you would be able to pass Qua\+Zip\+File as well as many other nice things such as Q\+Buffer or Q\+Process. Of course, that\textquotesingle{}s only possible if you have control over the sources of the particular class.

Q. Can Qua\+Z\+IP handle files larger than 4GB? What about zip64 standard?

A. Starting with version 0.\+6, Qua\+Z\+IP uses Minizip 1.\+1 with zip64 support which should handle large files perfectly. The zip64 support in Minizip looks like it\textquotesingle{}s not 100\% conforming to the standard, but 3rd party tools seem to have no problem with the resulting archives.

Q. Can Qua\+Z\+IP write archives to a sequential Q\+I\+O\+Device like Q\+Tcp\+Socket?

A. Yes, it\textquotesingle{}s possible since Qua\+Z\+IP v0.\+7. It\textquotesingle{}s only possible in md\+Create mode, no md\+Append support.

Q. Can I use another version of Minizip in Qua\+Z\+IP, not the bundled one?

A. No, unfortunately not. To support reading/writing Z\+IP archives from/to Q\+I\+O\+Device objects, some modifications were needed to Minizip. Now that there is a Minizip fork on Git\+Hub, it is theoretically possible to backport these modifications into Minizip in a backward-\/compatible manner to ensure seamless integration with Qua\+Z\+IP, but it hasn\textquotesingle{}t been done yet, and there are no short-\/term plans, only a long-\/term goal.
