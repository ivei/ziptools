\href{http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html}{\texttt{ Minizip, or Gilles Vollant\textquotesingle{}s Z\+I\+P/\+U\+N\+Z\+IP package}} is a simple C library for creating, appending and reading Z\+IP archives.

\href{http://qt.io/}{\texttt{ Qt}} is a very powerful cross-\/platform C++ library with a lot of useful modules and classes. With Qt, you can create rich G\+U\+Is, perform networking activities, accessing databases and much much more. If Java is “write once, run everywhere”, Qt is “write once, compile everywhere” which is not that bad either.

One thing Qt can\textquotesingle{}t do out-\/of-\/the-\/box is write and read Z\+IP archives. Of course, you can do it with Minizip, but Minizip has its own interface which isn\textquotesingle{}t exactly compatible with Qt. Namely, in Qt there is an abstract class called Q\+I\+O\+Device, which is Qt-\/speak for “input/output stream”. There are a lot of classes that accept Q\+I\+O\+Device to write some useful things to it—you could serialize X\+ML to a Q\+I\+O\+Device, for example. Therefore, wouldn\textquotesingle{}t it be useful if you could open a Q\+I\+O\+Device that would write directly to a file in a Z\+IP archive? Or read from one? That\textquotesingle{}s exactly where Qua\+Z\+IP comes into the picture.

Technically speaking, Qua\+Z\+IP is a simple C++ wrapper around Minizip. Or you could call it an implementation of the Adapter pattern. With Qua\+Z\+IP, both Z\+IP files and files inside Z\+IP archives can be accessed with Q\+I\+O\+Device A\+PI. You can even write Z\+IP files to a sequential devices like T\+CP sockets, although some limitations apply in this case.\hypertarget{index_download}{}\doxysection{Download Qua\+Z\+IP}\label{index_download}
The latest downloads are available from the \href{https://github.com/stachenov/quazip/releases}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub page}}. Downloads are in source format. The documentation you\textquotesingle{}re reading right now can be build with the “doxygen” tool if you have one installed. Just run it from the project directory and it will create the “doc” directory for you. If you don\textquotesingle{}t have Doxygen installed, you can still read offline docs in the “quazip/doc” subdir and in the header files. Don\textquotesingle{}t confuse those dirs\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item “doc” in the project\textquotesingle{}s root is where Doxygen {\itshape output} is.
\item “quazip/doc” is where Doxygen {\itshape input} is, along with the header files.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Older downloads are available from \href{http://sourceforge.net/projects/quazip/}{\texttt{ Qua\+Z\+IP project\textquotesingle{}s page at Source\+Forge.\+net}}.\hypertarget{index_platforms}{}\doxysection{Platforms supported}\label{index_platforms}
Qua\+Z\+IP is regularly tested on the following platforms\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item linux-\/g++ (Ubuntu 16.\+04 L\+TS, Qt 5.\+5.\+1)
\item linux-\/g++ (Cent\+OS 6.\+9, Qt 4.\+6.\+2)
\item win32-\/msvc (MS V\+S/\+VC 2013 64-\/bit, Qt 5.\+9.\+2)
\end{DoxyItemize}

It should work fine on any platform supported by Qt 4.\+6.\+2 or later. In theory, older versions might work as well, but aren\textquotesingle{}t guaranteed to.\hypertarget{index_whats-new}{}\doxysection{What is new in this version of Qua\+Z\+I\+P?}\label{index_whats-new}
See the N\+E\+W\+S.\+txt file supplied with the distribution.\hypertarget{index_Dependencies}{}\doxysection{Dependencies}\label{index_Dependencies}
Just \href{http://www.zlib.org/}{\texttt{ zlib}} and Qt 4/5. Sometimes you can get away with using zlib library bundled into Qt, but usually you need at least its headers.\hypertarget{index_building}{}\doxysection{Building, testing and installing}\label{index_building}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Instructions given in this section assume that you are using some U\+N\+IX dialect, but the build process should be very similar on win32-\/g++ platform too. On other platforms it\textquotesingle{}s essentially the same process, maybe with some qmake adjustments not specific to Qua\+Z\+IP itself.
\end{DoxyNote}
To build the library, run\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ cd /wherever/quazip/source/is/quazip-x.y.z/quazip
$ qmake <qmake args> [PREFIX=where-to-install]
$ make
\end{DoxyVerb}


Make sure that you have Qt 4/5 installed with all required headers and utilities (that is, including the \textquotesingle{}dev\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}devel\textquotesingle{} package on Linux) and that you run qmake utility of the Qt 4/5, not some other version you may have already installed (you may need to type full path to qmake like /usr/local/qt4/bin/qmake).

To reconfigure (with another P\+R\+E\+F\+IX, for example), just run \begin{DoxyVerb}qmake distclean
\end{DoxyVerb}
 and then qmake with the appropriate arguments again.

Usually, it is needed to specify additional include path or libraries in qmake args (see qmake reference in the Qt documentation). For example\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}$ qmake LIBS+=-L/usr/local/zlib/lib INCLUDEPATH+=/usr/local/zlib/include
\end{DoxyVerb}
 (note abscence of “-\/\+I” before the include path and the presence of “-\/\+L” before the lib path)

Also note that you may or may not need to define Z\+L\+I\+B\+\_\+\+W\+I\+N\+A\+PI (qmake D\+E\+F\+I\+N\+E\+S+=Z\+L\+I\+B\+\_\+\+W\+I\+N\+A\+PI) when linking to zlib on Windows, depending on how zlib was built (generally, if using zlibwapi.\+dll, this define is needed).

To install compiled library\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ make install
\end{DoxyVerb}


By default, Qua\+Z\+IP compiles as a D\+L\+L/\+SO, but you have other options\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Just copy appropriate source files to your project and use them, but you need to define Q\+U\+A\+Z\+I\+P\+\_\+\+S\+T\+A\+T\+IC before including any Qua\+Z\+IP headers (best done as a compiler option). This will save you from possible side effects of importing/exporting Qua\+Z\+IP symbols.
\item Compile it as a static library using C\+O\+N\+F\+IG += staticlib qmake option. Q\+U\+A\+Z\+I\+P\+\_\+\+S\+T\+A\+T\+IC is defined automatically by qmake in this case.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Binary compatibility is guaranteed between minor releases starting with version 0.\+5, thanks to the Pimpl idiom. That is, the next binary incompatible version will be 1.\+x in the worst case.\hypertarget{index_test}{}\doxysection{Testing}\label{index_test}
To check if Qua\+Z\+IP\textquotesingle{}s basic features work OK on your platform, you may wish to compile the test suite provided in test directory\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ cd /wherever/quazip/source/is/quazip-x.y.z/qztest
$ qmake
$ make
$ ./qztest
\end{DoxyVerb}


Note that the test suite looks for the quazip library in the “quazip” folder of the project (“../quazip”), but you may wish to use L\+I\+BS for some systems (Windows often puts the library in the separate “debug” or “release” directory). If you wish to use the quazip version that\textquotesingle{}s already installed, provide the appropriate path.

On some systems you may need to set P\+A\+TH, L\+D\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+R\+Y\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH or S\+H\+L\+I\+B\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH to get “qztest” to actually run and to use the right version.

If everything went fine, the test suite should report a lot of P\+A\+SS messages. If something goes wrong, it will provide details and a warning that some tests failed.\hypertarget{index_using}{}\doxysection{Using}\label{index_using}

This wrapper has been written by Sergei Tachenov. This is my first open source project, and it\textquotesingle{}s pretty old, but it works and many people are happily using it, including myself.

If you have anything to say to me about Qua\+Z\+IP library, feel free to do so (read the \mbox{\hyperlink{faq}{Qua\+Z\+IP F\+AQ}} first, though). I can not promise, though, that I fix all the bugs you report in, add any features you want, or respond to your critics, or respond to your feedback at all. I may be busy, I may be tired of working on Qua\+Z\+IP, I may be even dead already (you never know...).

To report bugs or to post ideas about what should be done, use \href{https://github.com/stachenov/quazip}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub}}. It\textquotesingle{}s an awesome site, where you can report bugs or register yourself an account, fork Qua\+Z\+IP (don\textquotesingle{}t hesitate to do so), create a new branch, make some changes and issue a \href{https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/}{\texttt{ pull request}}, which is Git\+Hub\textquotesingle{}s way of offering patches. See C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+I\+B\+U\+T\+I\+N\+G.\+md file for details.

Do not use e-\/mail to report bugs, please. Reporting bugs and problems with Git\+Hub has that advantage that it is visible to public, and I can always search for open tickets that were created long ago. It is highly unlikely that I will search my mail for that kind of stuff, so if a bug reported by mail isn\textquotesingle{}t fixed immediately, it will likely be forgotten forever.

Old bugs may still be available at \href{https://sourceforge.net/projects/quazip/}{\texttt{ Source\+Forge}} for reference.
